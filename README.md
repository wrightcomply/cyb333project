# CYB333 Security Automation Final Project
<p>This project is based on a video course authored by Thomas McNeela called Python for Automating Security [Video] (McNella, 2020). The content includes seven sections as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading, Modifying and Testing an Exploit Script</li>
  <li>Analyzing a Packet Capture File</li>
  <li>Gathing Open-Source Intelligence</li>
  <li>Analyzing a Log File</li>
  <li>Write a Paython Replacement for Netcat</li>
  <li>Collecting Network Packets Off the Wire</li>
  <li>Build a complete Penetration Testing Tool based on the first six sections above</li></ul>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong> includes an overview of a virtual environment that is required to construct all the Python functions and methods for each section. It also includes how to find, understand, modify, and tests an exploit script authored in Python. The latter rewrites the entire exploit in Python for more portability and demonstrates the power and simplicity of using Python for automating security testing.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2</strong> follows with understanding packet capture files followed by writing a Python code analyzing a packet capture file automatically and looking for unusual network activity.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>Section 3</strong> delves into open source intelligence and then uses Python by automating the gathering of certain types of OS sent. Consequently culminating in a handy penetration test in <strong>Section 4</strong>, similar to the process outlined in <strong>Section 2</strong>.</p> 
In Section 4, analyzes a server log file looking for unusual activity followed by writing Python code automating the analysis process. 
Section 5 starts with the theory of netcat, which is a helpful tool in penetration testing. Still, system administrators often wisely block it from running on machines due to its potential for abuse. However, this section demonstrates how to write a Python replacement for Netcat, which can subsequently be used on any system that supports Python.
Section 6 shows how to capture network packets off the wire used in many penetration tests. It is a very useful process to perform live packet captures to analyze whatâ€™s going on with the network, thereby creating the capability to see how to capture plaintext credentials off the network traffic and finally write an offensive tool for cache poisoning. 
Section 7 finishes by bringing together all that was learned in the other sections and practical approaches by writing comprehensive penetration testing. The code combines multiple techniques into one comprehensive tool.
